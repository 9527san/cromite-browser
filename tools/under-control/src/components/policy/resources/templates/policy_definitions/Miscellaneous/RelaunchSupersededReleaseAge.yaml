caption: Notify users of superseded browser versions
desc: |-
  Specifies the minimum release age beyond which relaunch notifications are more aggressive. The age is calculated from the time the currently-running version was last served to clients.

  If a new version is pending, a browser relaunch or device restart is needed, and the current version has been superseded for more than the number of days specified by this setting, the <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_PERIOD_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotificationPeriod</ph> policy is overridden to 2 hours. If the <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotification</ph> policy is set to 1 ('Required'), users will be forced to relaunch or restart at the end of the period.

  If not set, or if the release age cannot be determined, the <ph name="RELAUNCH_NOTIFICATION_PERIOD_POLICY_NAME">RelaunchNotificationPeriod</ph> policy will be used for all updates.
